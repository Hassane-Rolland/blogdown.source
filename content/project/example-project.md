45,700 (in November 2015) spider species were recorded by taxonomists. With that amount of species, you can guess that they have different ways of hunting. Some spiders run to hunt, some wait on their web or hidden beneath the ground. 
There is plenty of web types but I am going to write only about the orb webs. 



First of all, letâ€™s mention the web. It is made of spider silk, a protein fibre with awesome mechanical properties. A spider can make different types of silk according to the the use : resistant for support, sticky for hunting, elastic, .. They control the type of silk thank to their different glands.

For a very long time, I have been wondering how they could create such a symetrical structure. They have no ruler, no tools. They actually use their own body for measurements.

The distance between the spirals is measured with the legs.


In order to create their webs, spiders climb a structure and produce an adhesive thread. That thread will, with the wind, stick to a further structure. That makes now a single strand, the spider then tightens it and strengthens it with several other strands.
When that is done, the spider gets in the middle of the first linear structure and climbs down to make a Y-shaped web.

Several radial strands are added, and after that comes the circular strand. The spider finally fortifies the structure with sticky spirals. The non-adhesive spirals can then be removed, the spider chew these off.
